## <a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works">How it works</a>

The OAuth 2 plugin must be enabled (or [pre-configured](./plugins.html#enabled-plugins-file)) before it can be used, like all other plugins:

<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2
</pre>

Then it must be specified as one of the [authN and authZ backends](./access-control.html#backends). It can be
one of the backends or the only one backend, like in the example below:

<pre class="lang-ini">
# note that the module name begins with a "rabbit_", not "rabbitmq_", like in the name
# of the plugin
auth_backends.1 = rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2
</pre>

Next, let's take a look at the workflows the OAuth 2 plugin supports.

### <a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

To use this plugin, all RabbitMQ nodes must be

1. [configured to use the rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2 backend](./access-control.html).
2. configured with the resource service ID (`resource_server_id`). The RabbitMQ cluster becomes an OAuth 2.0 resource and this is its identifier.
3. configured with issuer URL of the OAuth 2.0 provider or the JWKS URL or directly with the signing keys the OAuth 2.0 provider will use to sign tokens

Here is the minimal configuration to support OAuth 2.0 authentication (*Note*: To enable it in the management plugin you need additional configuration):

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq
</pre>

Based on the above configuration, JWT Tokens presented to RabbitMQ for authentication must:

1. be digitally signed
2. have a value in the `aud` field that matches `resource_server_id` value
3. scopes must match the `resource_server_id` value , e.g. `new_resource_server_id.read:*/*`

And the `https://my-oauth2-provider.com/realm/rabbitmq/`*.well-known/openid-configuration* must return the OpenID Provider Configuration which includes the JKWS url to download the signing keys (*Note*: *.well-known/openid-configuration* is the OpenID standard path for the OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint).

The next sections cover in more detail what happens during authentication and how to configure OAuth 2.0 beyond the basic configuration shown above.

### <a id="authorization-flow" class="anchor" href="#authorization-flow-with-scopes">Authorization Flow</a>

This plugin does not communicate with any OAuth 2.0 provider in order to authenticate user and grants access. Instead, it decodes an access token provided by the client and authorises a user based on the scopes found in the token.

Tokens must be digitally signed in order to be accepted. RabbitMQ must have the signing key to validate the signature. You can either configure the signing keys the OAuth 2.0 provider will use or configure RabbitMQ with one of the two endpoints below:

  - **JWKS endpoint** - this is the HTTP endpoint that returns the signing keys used to digitally sign the tokens.
  - **OpenID Provider Configuration endpoint** - this is the endpoint that returns the provider's configuration including all its endpoints, such as the **JWKS endpoint**.

When you configure RabbitMQ with one these URLs, RabbitMQ must make a HTTP request (or two, if we specify the latter endpoint) to download the signing keys. This is an operation that occurs once for any signing key not downloaded yet. When the OAuth 2.0 provider rotates the signing keys, newer tokens refer to a new signing key which RabbitMQ does not have yet which triggers another download of the newer signing keys.

The token can be any [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction/) which contains the `scope` and `aud` fields.

1. Client requests an `access_token` from the OAuth 2.0 provider,
2. Token **scope** returned by OAuth 2.0 provider must include RabbitMQ resource scopes that follow a convention used by this plugin: `configure:%2F/foo` means "configure permissions for 'foo' in vhost '/'") (`scope` field can be changed using `extra_scopes_source` in **advanced.config** file.
3. Client passes the token as password when connecting to a RabbitMQ node. **The username field is ignored**.
4. RabbitMQ validates the token's signature. To do so it must have the signing keys or download them from the JWKS endpoint as explained in earlier sections
5. RabbitMQ validates the token has the **audience** matching the `resource_server_id`
6. RabbitMQ translates the scopes found in the token into RabbitMQ permissions (same permissions used in the RabbitMQ's internal database)

Here are two sample configuration. The first one configures two signing key files:

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = my_custom_scope_key
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.1 = username
auth_oauth2.preferred_username_claims.2 = user_name
auth_oauth2.default_key = id1
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id1 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/key.pem
auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id2 = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cert.pem
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
</pre>

And a second one which configures a signing key server:
<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = new_resource_server_id
auth_oauth2.jwks_url = https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = test/config_schema_SUITE_data/certs/cacert.pem
auth_oauth2.https.peer_verification = verify_peer
auth_oauth2.https.depth = 5
auth_oauth2.https.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true
auth_oauth2.https.hostname_verification = wildcard
auth_oauth2.algorithms.1 = HS256
auth_oauth2.algorithms.2 = RS256
</pre>

Each `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.<id/index>.` entry has the following settings:

* `id`
* `resource_server_type`
* `additional_scopes_key`  
* `scope_prefix`  
* `preferred_username_claims`
* `oauth_provider_id`

Typically, a numeric value is used as `index`, e.g.  `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`. However, it can be any string, e.g. `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.rabbit_prod.jwks_url = http://some_url`. By default, the `index` is the resource server's id. However, you can override it via the `id` attribute like in `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod`.

Here is an example which configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) which are used by the users and clients managed by
the same Identity Provider whose issuer url is `https://my-idp.com/`:
<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp.com/
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
</pre>

Each `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.<id/index>.` entry has the following settings:

* `issuer`
* `token_endpoint`
* `jwks_uri`
* `https.cacertfile`
* `https.depth`
* `https.verify`
* `https.fail_if_no_peer_cert`
* `https.hostname_verification`


Here is an example which configures two resources (`prod` and `dev`) where each resource is managed by two distinct identity providers:
<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = idp_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = idp_dev
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_prod.issuer = https://idp_prod.com
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.idp_dev.issuer = https://idp_dev.com
</pre>

### <a id="resource-server-id" class="anchor" href="#resource-server-id">Resource Server ID and scope prefix</a>

OAuth 2.0 tokens use scopes to communicate what set of permissions particular
client has been granted. The scopes are free form strings.

By default, `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character is the prefix used for scopes to avoid scope collisions (or unintended overlap).
However, in some environments, it is not possible to use `resource_server_id` as the prefix for all scopes. For these environments, there is a new setting called `scope_prefix` which overrides the default scope prefix. Empty strings are allowed.

Given the below configuration, the scope associated to the permission `read:*/*` is `api://read:*/*`.
<pre class="lang-ini">
...
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = api://
...
</pre>


### <a id="token-validation" class="anchor" href="#token-validation">Token validation</a>

When RabbitMQ receives a JWT token, it validates it before accepting it.

#### Must be digitally signed

The token must carry a digital signature and optionally a `kid` header attribute which identifies the key RabbitMQ should
use to validate the signature.

#### Must not be expired

RabbitMQ uses this field `exp` ([exp](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) to validate the token if present.
It contains the expiration time after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.

#### Audience must have/match the resource_server_id

The `aud` ([Audience](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-9)) identifies the recipients and/or resource_server of the JWT. By default, **RabbitMQ uses this field to validate the token** although you can deactivate it by setting `verify_aud` to `false`.  When it set to `true`, this attribute must either match the `resource_server_id` setting or in case of a list, it must contain the `resource_server_id`.

### <a id="token-expiration" class="anchor" href="#token-expiration">Token Expiration and Refresh</a>

On an existing connection the token can be refreshed by the [update-secret](./amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.update-secret) AMQP 0.9.1 method.
Please check your client whether it supports this method (e.g. documentation for the [Java client](./api-guide.html#oauth2-refreshing-token)).
Otherwise the client has to disconnect and reconnect to use a new token.

If the latest token expires on an existing connection, after a limited time the broker will refuse all operations (but it won't disconnect).

### <a id="scope-translation" class="anchor" href="#scope-translation">Scope-to-Permission Translation</a>

Scopes are translated into permission grants to RabbitMQ resources for the provided token.

The current scope format is `&lt;permission>:&lt;vhost_pattern>/&lt;name_pattern>[/&lt;routing_key_pattern>]` where

 * `<permission>` is an access permission (`configure`, `read`, or `write`)
 * `<vhost_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for vhosts token has access to.
 * `<name_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for resource name
 * `&lt;routing_key_pattern>` is a wildcard pattern for routing key in topic authorization

Wildcard patterns are strings with optional wildcard symbols `*` that match
any sequence of characters.

Wildcard patterns match as following:

 * `*` matches any string
 * `foo*` matches any string starting with a `foo`
 * `*foo` matches any string ending with a `foo`
 * `foo*bar` matches any string starting with a `foo` and ending with a `bar`

There can be multiple wildcards in a pattern:

 * `start*middle*end`
 * `*before*after*`

**To use special characters like `*`, `%`, or `/` in a wildcard pattern,
the pattern must be [URL-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).**

These are the typical permissions examples:

- `read:*/*`(`read:*/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `write:*/*`(`write:*/*/*`) - write permissions to any resource on any vhost
- `read:vhost1/*`(`read:vhost1/*/*`) - read permissions to any resource on the `vhost1` vhost
- `read:vhost1/some*` - read permissions to all the resources, starting with `some` on the `vhost1` vhost
- `write:vhost1/some*/routing*` - topic write permissions to publish to an exchange starting with `some` with a routing key starting with `routing`
- `read:*/*/*` and `write:*/*/*` - queue binding permissions required to bind a queue on a topic exchange with any routing key

See the [wildcard matching test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/wildcard_match_SUITE.erl) and [scopes test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/test/scope_SUITE.erl) for more examples.

Scopes, by default, are prefixed with `resource_server_id` followed by the dot (`.`) character if `scope_prefix`
is not configured. For example, if `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope to enable read from any vhost will
be `my_rabbit.read:*/*`.

If `scope_prefix` is configured then scopes are prefixed as follows: `<scope_prefix><permission>`. For example,
if `scope_prefix` is `api://` and the permission is `read:*/*` the scope would be `api://read:*/*`

### <a id="topic-exchange-scopes" class="anchor" href="#topic-exchange-scopes">Topic Exchange scopes</a>

The [previous](#scope-translation) section explained, in detail, how permissions are mapped to scopes. This section explains more specifically what scopes you need in order to operate on **Topic Exchanges**.

To bind and/or unbind a queue to/from a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scopes:

- **write** permission on the queue and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<queue>/<routingkey>`
> e.g. `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

- **read** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`
> e.g. `rabbitmq.read:*/*/*`

To publish to a **Topic Exchange**, you need to have the following scope:

- **write** permission on the exchange and routing key -> `rabbitmq.write:<vhost>/<exchange>/<routingkey>`
> e.g. `rabbitmq.write:*/*/*`

OAuth 2.0 authorisation backend supports variable expansion when checking permission on topics.
It supports JWT claims whose value is a plain string, plus the `vhost` variable.

For example, a user connected with the token below to the vhost `prod` should have
a write permission on all exchanges starting with `x-prod-`, and any routing key starting with `u-bob-`:

<pre class="lang-json">
{
  "sub" : "bob",
  "scope" : [ "rabbitmq.write:*/q-{vhost}-*/u-{sub}-*" ]
}
</pre>


### <a id="scope-and-tags" class="anchor" href="#scope-and-tags">Scope and Tags</a>

Users in RabbitMQ can have [tags associated with them](./access-control.html#user-tags).
Tags are used to [control access to the management plugin](./management.html#permissions).

In the OAuth context, tags can be added as part of the scope, using a format like `&lt;resource_server_id>.tag:&lt;tag>`. For example, if `resource_server_id` is "my_rabbit", a scope to grant access to the management plugin with
the `monitoring` tag will be `my_rabbit.tag:monitoring`.

## <a id="basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage">Basic usage</a>


## <a id="configure-issuer" class="anchor" href="#configure-issuer">Configure OAuth 2.0 provider's issuer</a>

Before RabbitMQ 3.13, users had to set the JWKS endpoint (i.e. `auth_oauth2.jwks_url` setting) or statically <a href="#configure-signing-key">configure the signing keys</a>. Now, users can instead configure the OpenID Provider's issuer URL and from this URL RabbitMQ downloads the OpenID Provider configuration which includes the JWKS endpoint in addition to other endpoints which will be useful in other contexts.

Typically, this same `issuer` URL has been the same URL configured in the management plugin (`management.oauth_provider_url`). From now on, it is only necessary to configure a single URL, specified by the `auth_oauth2.issuer` setting.

Sample configuration using issuer:
<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://my-idp-provider/somerealm
</pre>

or

<pre class="lang-erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"my_rabbit_server">>},
    {issuer, &lt;&lt;"https://my-idp-provider/somerealm">>}    
  ]},
].
</pre>

Sample configuration using jwks_url:
<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = my_rabbit_server
auth_oauth2.jwks_url = "https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json
</pre>

or

<pre class="lang-erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"my_rabbit_server">>},
    {key_config, [
      {jwks_url, &lt;&lt;"https://my-jwt-issuer/jwks.json">>}
    ]}
  ]},
].
</pre>

**Note**: If you have both endpoints configured, RabbitMQ will use `jwks_url` given that it does not have to discover it via the `issuer` url.

**Note about TLS settings for the `jwks_url` or the `issuer` url**: TLS setting such as the `cacertfile` are configured as follows regardless which url we are using:

<pre class="lang-ini">
...
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/cacert.pem
...
</pre>

or

<pre class="lang-erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    ...
    {key_config, [
      {cacertfile, &lt;&lt;"/opts/certs/cacert.pem">>}
    ]}
  ]},
].
</pre>


## <a id="configure-signing-keys" class="anchor" href="#configure-signing-keys">Configure Signing Keys</a>

Nowadays it is very rare you configure RabbitMQ with signing keys, when RabbitMQ can automatically download them as explained in the previous section. However, RabbitMQ supports those edge cases where you need to statically configure the signing keys, or when you need to support symmetric signing keys as opposed to the most widely used asymmetric keys.

The example given below uses [Cloud Foundry UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) as OAuth 2.0 provider.

To get the signing key from the [OAuth 2.0 provider UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa), use the
[token_key endpoint](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.6.0/index.html#token-key-s)
or [uaac](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) (the `uaac signing key` command).

The following fields are required: `kty`, `value`, `alg`, and `kid`.

Assuming UAA reports the following signing key information:

<pre class="lang-erlang">
uaac signing key
  kty: RSA
  e: AQAB
  use: sig
  kid: a-key-ID
  alg: RS256

    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"my_rabbit_server">>},

### <a id="use-different-token-field" class="anchor" href="#use-different-token-field">Using a different token field for the Scope</a>

By default the plugin will look for the `scope` key in the token, you can configure the plugin to also look in other fields using the `extra_scopes_source` setting. Values format accepted are scope as **string** or **list**


<pre class="lang-erlang">
[
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"my_rabbit_server">>},
    {extra_scopes_source, &lt;&lt;"my_custom_scope_key">>},
    ...
    ]}
  ]},
].
</pre>
Token sample:
<pre class="lang-ini">
{
 "exp": 1618592626,
 "iat": 1618578226,
 "aud" : ["my_id"],
 ...
 "scope_as_string": "my_id.configure:*/* my_id.read:*/* my_id.write:*/*",
 "scope_as_list": ["my_id.configure:*/*", "my_id.read:*/*", my_id.write:*/*"],
 ...
 }
</pre>



### <a id="preferred-username-claims" class="anchor" href="#preferred-username-claims">Preferred username claims</a>

The username associated with the token must be available to RabbitMQ so that this username is displayed in the RabbitMQ Management UI.
By default, RabbitMQ searches for the `sub` claim first, and if it is not found, RabbitMQ uses the `client_id`.

Most authorization servers return the user's GUID in the `sub` claim instead of the user's username or email address, anything the user can relate to. When the `sub` claim does not carry a *user-friendly username*, you can configure one or several claims to extract the username from the token.

Example `advanced.config` configuration:

<pre class="lang-erlang">
  ...
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2, [
    {resource_server_id, &lt;&lt;"rabbitmq"&gt;&gt;},
    {preferred_username_claims, [&lt;&lt;"user_name"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"email"&gt;&gt;]},
  ...
</pre>
In the example configuration, RabbitMQ searches for the `user_name` claim first and if it is not found, RabbitMQ searches for the `email`. If these are not found, RabbitMQ uses its default lookup mechanism which first looks for `sub` and then `client_id`.

### <a id="rich-authorization-request" class="anchor" href="#rich-authorization-request">Rich Authorization Request</a>

The [Rich Authorization Request](https://oauth.net/2/rich-authorization-requests/) extension provides a way for
OAuth clients to request fine-grained permissions during an authorization request.
It moves away from the concept of scopes that are text labels and instead
defines a more sophisticated permission model.

RabbitMQ supports JWT tokens compliant with the extension. Below is a sample example section of JWT token:

<pre class="lang-javascript">
{
  "authorization_details": [
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:production-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    {
      "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

The token above contains two permissions under the attribute `authorization_details`.
Both permissions are meant for RabbitMQ servers with `resource_server_type` set to `rabbitmq`.
This field identifies RabbitMQ-specific permissions.

The first permission grants `read`, `write` and `configure` permissions to any
queue and/or exchange on any virtual host whose name matches the pattern `production-*`,
and that reside in clusters whose `resource_server_id` contains the string `finance`.
The `cluster` attribute's value is also a regular expression. To match exactly the
string `finance`, use `^finance$`.

The second permission grants the `administrator` user tag in two clusters, `finance`
and `inventory`. Other supported user tags as `management`, `policymaker` and `monitoring`.


#### Type field

In order for a RabbitMQ node to accept a permission, its value must match that
node's `resource_server_type` setting value. A JWT token may have permissions
for multiple resource types.

#### Locations field

The `locations` field can be either a string containing a single location or a Json array containing
zero or many locations.

A location consists of a list of key-value pairs separated by forward slash `/` character. Here is the format:
<pre class="lang-bash">
cluster:&lt;resource_server_id_pattern>[/vhost:&lt;vhost_pattern>][/queue:&lt;queue_name_pattern>|/exchange:&lt;exchange_name_pattern][/routing-key:&lt;routing_key_pattern>]
</pre>

Any string separated by `/` which does not conform to `&lt;key>:&lt;value>` is ignored. For instance, if your locations start with a prefix, e.g. `vrn/cluster:rabbitmq`, the `vrn` pattern part is ignored.

The supported location's attributed are:

- `cluster`: This is the only mandatory attribute. It is a wildcard pattern which must match RabbitMQ's `resource_server_id` otherwise the location is ignored.
- `vhost`: This is the virtual host you are granting access to. It also a wildcard pattern. If not specified, `*` will be used.
- `queue`|`exchange`: queue or exchange name pattern. The location grants the permission to a set of queues (or exchanges) that match it. One location can only specify either `queue` or `exchange` but not both. If not specified, `*` will be used
- `routing-key`: this is the routing key pattern the location grants the permission to. If not specified, `*` will be used

For more information about wildcard patterns, check the section [Scope-to-Permission Translation](#scope-to-permission-translation).

#### Actions field

The `actions` field can be either a string containing a single action or a Json array containing zero or many actions.

The supported actions map to either [RabbitMQ permissions](./access-control.html#authorisation):

- `configure`
- `read`
- `write`

Or RabbitMQ user tags:

- `administrator`
- `monitoring`
- `management`
- `policymaker`

#### Rich-Permission to Scope translation

Rich Authorization Request permissions are translated into JWT token scopes that use the
aforementioned convention using the following algorithm:

For each location found in the `locations` where the `cluster` attribute matches the current RabbitMQ server's `resource_server_id`:

  - For each location found in the `locations` field where the `cluster` attribute matches the current RabbitMQ node's `resource_server_id`, the plugin extracts the `vhost`, `queue` or `exchange` and `routing_key` attributes from the location. If the location does not  have any of those attributes, the default value of `*` is assumed. Out of those values, the following scope suffix will be produced:
    <pre class="lang-ini">scope_suffix = &lt;vhost>/&lt;queue>|&lt;exchange>/&lt;routing-key></pre>

  - For each action found in the `actions` field:

    if the action is not a known user tag, the following scope is produced out of it:
    <pre class="lang-ini">
      scope = &lt;resource_server_id>.&lt;action>:&lt;scope_suffix>
    </pre>

    For known user tag actions, the following scope is produced:
    <pre class="lang-ini">
      scope = &lt;resource_server_id>.&lt;action>
    </pre>


The plugin produces permutations of all `actions` by  all `locations` that match the node's configured `resource_server_id`.

In the following RAR example
<pre class="lang-javascript">
{
  "authorization_details": [
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance/vhost:primary-*"],
      "actions": [ "read", "write", "configure"  ]
    },
    { "type" : "rabbitmq",
      "locations": ["cluster:finance", "cluster:inventory" ],
      "actions": ["administrator" ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

if RabbitMQ node's `resource_server_id` is equal to `finance`, the plugin will compute the following sets of scopes:

- `finance.read:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.write:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.configure:primary-*/*/*`
- `finance.tag:administrator`



## <a id="advanced-usage" class="anchor" href="#advanced-usage">Advanced usage</a>

## <a id="use-oauth-provider" class="anchor" href="#use-oauth-provider">Use default OAuth 2.0 provider</a>

As long you have one and only one OAuth 2.0 provider, you can skip this advanced usage although you can use it.

Under the <a href="#configure-issuer">basic usage section</a>, you configured the `issuer` URL or maybe the `jwks_url` along with the TLS settings if needed. This advanced usage configures everything relative to the OAuth provider into a dedicated configuration.

Here is a basic configuration as seen so far:

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
</pre>

And the equivalent advanced configuration:

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = rabbitmq-prod
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.
auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider = prodkeycloak

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.issuer = https://prodkeycloak:8080/realm/prod
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prodkeycloak.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prodcacert.pem
</pre>

This advanced configuration will be more relevant when users present tokens which have been issued or signed by different OAuth 2.0 providers. However, one can still use it provided `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider` is set.

### <a id="multiple-resource-servers" class="anchor" href="#multiple-resource-servers">Multiple Resource Servers</a>

Typically, all users that access a RabbitMQ cluster are registered within the same identity provider. And likewise, all tokens targeting the same RabbitMQ cluster also carry the same *audience*. In other words, all users reference a RabbitMQ cluster with the same resource name which must match the value of the `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id` setting.

However, there are some use-cases where RabbitMQ is accessed by users registered in different Identity Providers or tokens are issued for the same RabbitMQ installation but with different *Audience*(s). For these use-cases, RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 plugin and the Management plugin can be configured with multiple OAuth 2.0 resources.

Below is the OAuth 2.0 plugin configuration for two resources with the ids, `rabbit_prod` and `rabbit_dev`. Both resources (a.k.a. *audience*) are managed by the same Identity Provider whose issuer is `http//some_idp_url`.

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.issuer = http//some_idp_url
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.
</pre>

All resource servers share the settings you have set so far under `auth_oauth2.` such as `scope_prefix`. However, they can override them. Here are the list of settings a resource server can override:
- `id` - This is the actual resource identifier carried in the `audience` field of a token. If omitted, the value is the index, e.g. given `auth_oauth2.resource_servers.prod.scope_prefix` setting, the `id` would be `prod`.
- `scope_prefix`
- `additional_scopes_key`
- `resource_server_type`
- `oauth_provider_id` - This is the identifier of the OAuth provider, configured in RabbitMQ, which provides all the settings to contact the authorization server in order to discover all its endpoints, such as the `jwks_uri` to download the signing keys to validate the token. If this setting is omitted, RabbitMQ looks up the default Authorization Provider's id in the setting `auth_oauth2.default_oauth_provider`. And if it is also omitted, RabbitMQ uses `auth_oauth2.issuer` or `auth_oauth2.jwks_url` to download the signings keys to validate the token.

The list of supported resource servers is the combination of `auth_oauth2.resource_servers` and `auth_oauth2.resource_server_id`. You can use both or only one of them.

**NOTE**: There is an [example](./oauth2-examples-multiresource.html) that demonstrate multiple OAuth 2 resources.

### <a id="multiple-oauth-providers" class="anchor" href="#multiple-oauth-providers">Multiple OAuth Providers</a>

It only makes sense to set multiple OAuth Providers if there are <a href="#multiple-resource-servers">multiple resources configured</a>.

This is the configuration used in the previous section but modified to use multiple OAuth providers:

<pre class="lang-ini">
auth_oauth2.scope_prefix = rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.id = rabbit_prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.1.oauth_provider_id = prod
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.id = rabbit_dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.oauth_provider_id = dev
auth_oauth2.resource_servers.2.scope_prefix = dev-rabbitmq.

auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.issuer = https://rabbit_prod:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.prod.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/prod.pem
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.issuer = https://rabbit_dev:8080
auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.dev.https.cacertfile = /opts/certs/dev.pem
</pre>

## <a id="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples">Examples</a>

The [RabbitMQ OAuth 2.0 Auth Backend Examples](oauth2-examples.html) contains many example configuration files which can be used to set up several OAuth 2.0 providers, including UAA, Auth0, and Azure, and issue tokens, which can be used to access RabbitMQ resources.
